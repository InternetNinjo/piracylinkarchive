If they don't, womp womp.</p> <p>fuck u big corporation</p> <p>if u try to dmca this site I will find u down and suck ur dick.</p> <p><code>&lt;RANT START&gt;</code></p> <p>Big corporations and DRM (Digital Rights Management) are the biggest assholes in the game, and I\u2019m not even gonna sugarcoat it. These greedy fucks couldn\u2019t give less of a shit about u, the paying customer. They\u2019ve made it their mission to treat everyone like a thief, all while screwing over the legit folks who just wanna enjoy the stuff they bought without jumping through a thousand hoops.</p> <p>Let\u2019s break this down. U drop cash on a game, movie, or album, and what do u get in return? Some bullshit restrictions wrapped in DRM. Suddenly, it\u2019s not your game anymore. Nah, it\u2019s like u rented it and need permission from the corporate overlords every time u wanna use it. Wanna play that single-player game offline? Fuck u. Got bad internet? Screw u, u can\u2019t even access what u paid for. It\u2019s like these companies are saying, \u201cThanks for the money, but we still own everything, and u just have the privilege of playing when we say so.\u201d</p> <p>What makes it worse is how utterly pointless DRM is. These big-ass corporations invest millions into these systems, all in the name of \u201cstopping piracy.\u201d But guess what? It doesn\u2019t even work. Hackers crack the DRM faster than it takes to boot up your damn console. So who gets punished here? Not the pirates\u2014they\u2019re playing that shit for free, DRM-free. It\u2019s the legit buyers like u and me, the ones who are actually supporting the industry, that get bent over. It\u2019s fucking ridiculous!</p> <p>DRM makes everything worse. Remember buying music on iTunes back in the day? U had to deal with Apple\u2019s restrictive DRM bullshit that only let u play your music on their devices. What the fuck is that about? U pay for the song, but they decide where u can play it. And if u wanted to use another player or device? Tough luck\u2014buy it again or spend hours converting it just to listen to something u own. But do u really own it? Nope. They\u2019ve got u by the balls with this digital prison.</p> <p>And here\u2019s the kicker: DRM doesn\u2019t just mess with new stuff. It totally screws over older content too. Wanna play that game from 10 years ago? Oh wait, the DRM servers went offline? Well, fuck u, u can\u2019t play it anymore. A game u bought with your hard-earned cash is now completely useless. It\u2019s like these corporations are saying, \u201cThanks for supporting us, but screw your nostalgia or desire to revisit this game. We\u2019ve moved on, and so should u.\u201d</p> <p>They also don\u2019t give a flying fuck about privacy. Some DRM schemes are straight-up spyware. They\u2019re snooping on your system, tracking data, and just invading your space, all under the guise of \u201cstopping piracy.\u201d It\u2019s such bullshit. U paid for the game, and now they\u2019re in your damn business? It\u2019s like buying a couch, and the salesman comes over every week to sit on it and see how u\u2019re using it. Get the fuck outta here with that nonsense.</p> <p>At the end of the day, big corporations and DRM are just another way for these greedy assholes to keep control over everything while they laugh at u. They don\u2019t trust u, they don\u2019t respect u, and they sure as hell don\u2019t care about u once they\u2019ve got your money. Fuck DRM, and fuck the companies pushing this garbage on us.</p> <p><code>&lt;RANT FINISHED&gt;</code></p> <p><code>&lt;RANT START&gt;</code></p> <p>Alright, let\u2019s dive into how DRM isn\u2019t just annoying as hell\u2014it\u2019s straight-up anti-poor, and that\u2019s some bullshit. Most of us out here don\u2019t have stacks of cash lying around, but these big corporations act like we\u2019re all rolling in dough and can afford to pay for the same product multiple times or deal with their overpriced, restrictive nonsense. DRM basically tells people, \u201cHey, if you\u2019re not rich enough to buy this shit again when something goes wrong, tough luck, sucker!\u201d</p> <p>Think about it. When u drop your hard-earned cash on something, u expect to own it, right? But DRM says, \u201cNah, you\u2019re only renting this.\u201d U get locked into using the product on one specific device or platform, and if u dare to upgrade your gear or switch systems? Guess what, u\u2019re probably gonna have to buy it again. For people with money, maybe that\u2019s not a big deal. But for those of us who can barely afford to make the first purchase, it\u2019s a massive slap in the face. Like, we saved up, finally got the game or software we wanted, and now they expect us to cough up more cash just because we wanna use it on a different device? Fuck outta here with that.</p> <p>DRM is essentially a middle finger to anyone who\u2019s struggling financially. Can\u2019t afford to constantly upgrade your internet? Well, sucks to be u, because a lot of these DRM-infested games require a constant connection, even for single-player games. So if u\u2019re living somewhere where the internet is garbage or super expensive, u\u2019re screwed. It\u2019s like these companies are saying, \u201cOnly people with stable internet deserve to play this game.\u201d It\u2019s the most classist shit ever.</p> <p>And let\u2019s not forget about regions where legit media isn\u2019t even available, or it\u2019s priced so ridiculously high that no one can afford it. Some places have absurdly inflated prices for digital products, and then DRM locks u into buying from that region. U can\u2019t even look for cheaper alternatives or import versions without getting hit by some stupid DRM restrictions. So, the poor folks living in places where media is priced sky-high? They\u2019re stuck paying way more than rich countries, all while getting less freedom with how they can use it. That\u2019s some next-level corporate greed right there.</p> <p>And don\u2019t even get me started on people who don\u2019t have access to legit stores. Not everyone lives in a country where there\u2019s a Best Buy on every corner, or where Steam, Netflix, or whatever works without restrictions. These companies act like the whole world is one big shopping mall with their products on every shelf, but for a lot of people, that\u2019s just not reality. DRM makes it impossible for people in less privileged places to even access content without either paying way more or resorting to piracy. It\u2019s like they\u2019re saying, \u201cIf u can\u2019t pay up or don\u2019t live in the right country, too bad.\u201d</p> <p>This is why DRM feels like an attack on poor people. It\u2019s designed by rich corporations for rich customers. It\u2019s not made for people like us who are just trying to get by and enjoy something without breaking the bank. Instead of making content more accessible, they put up walls and say, \u201cIf u can\u2019t afford to play by our rules, then fuck u.\u201d It\u2019s a greedy, classist system that punishes the very people who can\u2019t afford to keep jumping through their hoops.</p> <p>In the end, DRM does nothing but widen the gap between those who have money to burn and those who don\u2019t. If u\u2019re poor, u get stuck with fewer choices, more restrictions, and endless frustration while the wealthy get to bypass it all. It\u2019s bullshit, and the sooner these corporations realize they\u2019re screwing over the very people who need access the most, the better. But until then? DRM can go fuck itself.</p> <p><code>&lt;RANT FINISHED&gt;</code></p> <p><code>&lt;RANT START&gt;</code></p> <p>Denuvo is fucking trash, and I\u2019m sick of pretending otherwise. It\u2019s like the developers sat down and said, \u201cHow can we absolutely fuck over the people who actually pay for our games?\u201d Oh, I know\u2014let\u2019s throw in this piece of DRM that turns every gaming session into a stuttering, lag-ridden, unplayable mess! Seriously, fuck Denuvo and the idiots who keep shoving it into our games like it's a good idea.</p> <p>You buy a game, and instead of getting a smooth, fun experience, you get a fucking choppy slideshow because Denuvo is eating up your system resources like a parasite. Your expensive rig that you\u2019ve spent a fortune on? Doesn\u2019t matter. Denuvo will still shit all over it, throttling your CPU and making your game run like it's powered by a hamster on a wheel. It\u2019s the gaming equivalent of cancer\u2014it slows down everything, from loading times to frame rates, and it\u2019s completely fucking useless at what it\u2019s supposed to do: stop piracy.</p> <p>And don\u2019t get me started on how invasive this bullshit is. It buries itself deep into your system like some kind of malware. It\u2019s like, \u201cOh, you want to play the game you just bought? Well, too fucking bad, here\u2019s a bunch of background processes stealing your CPU cycles and making everything slow to a crawl.\u201d Fuck off! It\u2019s like you\u2019re being punished for actually supporting the developers. Meanwhile, the pirates who crack the game a day after release are sitting there with perfectly optimized versions, laughing their asses off at us for being such suckers.</p> <p>And what does Denuvo actually accomplish? Jack shit! Pirates crack it in days. Sometimes they don\u2019t even need that long. The only people who suffer are the ones who bought the game legally. How is that even remotely fucking fair? It\u2019s like being mugged twice\u2014once by the publisher and again by this useless fucking DRM. Even worse, a lot of developers end up removing Denuvo later because they finally realize what a clusterfuck it is. But by then, the damage is already done. The first few months of a game\u2019s life are ruined, and the reviews are tanked because no one could enjoy it at launch.</p> <p>In the end, Denuvo does nothing but fuck over legitimate customers. It\u2019s an absolute shitshow of a DRM system, and it needs to die a fiery fucking death. Every time I see a game with Denuvo, it\u2019s an instant \u201cfuck no\u201d from me.</p> <p><code>&lt;RANT FINISHED&gt;</code></p>"},{"location":"#how-can-you-contact-us","title":"How can you contact us?","text":"<ul> <li>Discord: zenithrifle</li> <li>Email: first@sharecrypt.uk</li> <li>Element: @eli32:nope.chat</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Anime/","title":"Anime","text":""},{"location":"Games/","title":"\ud83c\udfae Games","text":""},{"location":"Games/#starfield","title":"Starfield","text":"Starfield <pre>1337x FitGirl Repacks</pre> <pre>Steamrip 1ficher</pre> <pre>Starfield: Digital Premium Edition DODI Repacks Torrent File</pre> <pre>Starfield: Digital Premium Edition DODI Repacks Magnet Link</pre> <pre>Starfield: Digital Premium Edition DODI Repacks DataNodes</pre> <pre>Starfield: Digital Premium Edition GameBounty Direct Download DataNodes</pre> <pre>SCNLOG RUNE NitroFlare</pre> <pre>SCNLOG RUNE ddownload</pre> <pre>SCNLOG mirrorrace</pre>"},{"location":"Movies/","title":"\ud83c\udfac Movies","text":""},{"location":"Movies/#the-substance","title":"The Substance","text":"The Substance <pre>1337x 1080p WEBRIP</pre> <pre>Braflix Streaming</pre> <pre>VegaMovies Direct Download 1080p WEB-DL</pre> <pre>MovieParadise Direct Download 1080p WEBRip</pre>"},{"location":"Movies/#28-days-later","title":"28 Days Later","text":"28 Days Later <pre>1337x 1080p BluRay</pre> <pre>Braflix Streaming</pre> <pre>VegaMovies Direct Download 1080p BluRay</pre> <pre>HydraHD Streaming</pre>"},{"location":"Movies/#top-gun-maverick","title":"Top Gun Maverick","text":"Top Gun Maverick <pre>1337x 1080p HDTS</pre> <pre>Braflix Streaming</pre> <pre>VegaMovies Direct Download 1080p BluRay</pre>"},{"location":"Movies/#star-wars-the-last-jedi","title":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi","text":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi <pre>1337x 1080p BluRay</pre> <pre>Braflix Streaming</pre> <pre>VegaMovies Direct Download 1080p</pre>"},{"location":"Movies/#interstellar","title":"Interstellar","text":"Interstellar <pre>1337x 1080p BluRay</pre> <pre>Braflix Streaming</pre> <pre>VegaMovies Direct Download HDR 4K HDR IMAX BluRay</pre>"},{"location":"Movies/#spider-man-far-from-home","title":"Spider-Man: Far From Home","text":"Spider-Man: Far From Home <pre>1337x 1080p WEBRip</pre> <pre>Braflix Streaming</pre> <pre>VegaMovies Direct Download 10bit 4K</pre>"},{"location":"Movies/#home-alone","title":"Home Alone","text":"Home Alone <pre>1337x 720p BluRay</pre> <pre>Braflix Streaming</pre> <pre>VegaMovies Direct Download 720p</pre>"},{"location":"Movies/#deadpool-wolverine","title":"Deadpool &amp; Wolverine","text":"Deadpool &amp; Wolverine <pre>1337x 1080p AMAZON WEBRip</pre> <pre>Braflix Streaming</pre> <pre>VegaMovies Direct Download 1080p</pre>"},{"location":"Movies/#inside-out-2","title":"Inside Out 2","text":"Inside Out 2 <pre>1337x 1080p WEBDL Magnet</pre> <pre>1337x 1080p WEBDL Torrent File</pre> <pre>Braflix Streaming</pre> <pre>VegaMovies Direct Download 1080p</pre>"},{"location":"Movies/#jaws","title":"Jaws","text":"Jaws <pre>1337x 4K BluRay Magnet Link</pre> <pre>1337x 720p BluRay Magnet Link</pre> <pre>1337x 4K BluRay Torrent File</pre> <pre>1337x 720p BluRay Torrent File</pre> <pre>HydraHD Streaming</pre> <pre>Braflix Streaming</pre> <pre>DDLBase Direct Download 1ficher 1080p BluRay MKV REMUX</pre>"},{"location":"Movies/#the-matrix","title":"The Matrix","text":"The Matrix <pre>1337x 720p BluRay Magnet Link</pre> <pre>1337x 720p BluRay Torrent File</pre> <pre>HydraHD Streaming</pre> <pre>Braflix Streaming</pre>"},{"location":"Movies/#titanic","title":"Titanic","text":"Titanic <pre>1337x 1080p Magnet Link</pre> <pre>1337x 720p Magnet Link</pre> <pre>1337x 3D BluRay Magnet Link</pre> <pre>1337x 1080p Torrent File</pre> <pre>1337x 720p Torrent File</pre> <pre>1337x 3D BlueRay Torrent File</pre> <pre>HydraHD Streaming</pre> <pre>Braflix Streaming</pre>"}]}
