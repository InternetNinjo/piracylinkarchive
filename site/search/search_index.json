If they don't, womp womp.</p> <p>fuck u big corporation</p> <p>if u try to dmca this site I will find u down and suck ur dick.</p> <p><code>&lt;RANT START&gt;</code> Big corporations and DRM (Digital Rights Management) are the biggest assholes in the game, and I\u2019m not even gonna sugarcoat it. These greedy fucks couldn\u2019t give less of a shit about u, the paying customer. They\u2019ve made it their mission to treat everyone like a thief, all while screwing over the legit folks who just wanna enjoy the stuff they bought without jumping through a thousand hoops.</p> <p>Let\u2019s break this down. U drop cash on a game, movie, or album, and what do u get in return? Some bullshit restrictions wrapped in DRM. Suddenly, it\u2019s not your game anymore. Nah, it\u2019s like u rented it and need permission from the corporate overlords every time u wanna use it. Wanna play that single-player game offline? Fuck u. Got bad internet? Screw u, u can\u2019t even access what u paid for. It\u2019s like these companies are saying, \u201cThanks for the money, but we still own everything, and u just have the privilege of playing when we say so.\u201d</p> <p>What makes it worse is how utterly pointless DRM is. These big-ass corporations invest millions into these systems, all in the name of \u201cstopping piracy.\u201d But guess what? It doesn\u2019t even work. Hackers crack the DRM faster than it takes to boot up your damn console. So who gets punished here? Not the pirates\u2014they\u2019re playing that shit for free, DRM-free. It\u2019s the legit buyers like u and me, the ones who are actually supporting the industry, that get bent over. It\u2019s fucking ridiculous!</p> <p>DRM makes everything worse. Remember buying music on iTunes back in the day? U had to deal with Apple\u2019s restrictive DRM bullshit that only let u play your music on their devices. What the fuck is that about? U pay for the song, but they decide where u can play it. And if u wanted to use another player or device? Tough luck\u2014buy it again or spend hours converting it just to listen to something u own. But do u really own it? Nope. They\u2019ve got u by the balls with this digital prison.</p> <p>And here\u2019s the kicker: DRM doesn\u2019t just mess with new stuff. It totally screws over older content too. Wanna play that game from 10 years ago? Oh wait, the DRM servers went offline? Well, fuck u, u can\u2019t play it anymore. A game u bought with your hard-earned cash is now completely useless. It\u2019s like these corporations are saying, \u201cThanks for supporting us, but screw your nostalgia or desire to revisit this game. We\u2019ve moved on, and so should u.\u201d</p> <p>They also don\u2019t give a flying fuck about privacy. Some DRM schemes are straight-up spyware. They\u2019re snooping on your system, tracking data, and just invading your space, all under the guise of \u201cstopping piracy.\u201d It\u2019s such bullshit. U paid for the game, and now they\u2019re in your damn business? It\u2019s like buying a couch, and the salesman comes over every week to sit on it and see how u\u2019re using it. Get the fuck outta here with that nonsense.</p> <p>At the end of the day, big corporations and DRM are just another way for these greedy assholes to keep control over everything while they laugh at u. They don\u2019t trust u, they don\u2019t respect u, and they sure as hell don\u2019t care about u once they\u2019ve got your money. Fuck DRM, and fuck the companies pushing this garbage on us.</p> <p><code>&lt;RANT FINISHED&gt;</code></p>"},{"location":"#how-can-you-contact-us","title":"How can you contact us?","text":"<ul> <li>Discord: zenithrifle</li> <li>Email: first@sharecrypt.uk</li> <li>Element: @eli32:nope.chat</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Anime/","title":"Anime","text":""},{"location":"Games/","title":"\ud83c\udfae Games","text":""},{"location":"Games/#starfield","title":"Starfield","text":"Starfield <pre>1337x FitGirl Repacks</pre> <pre>Steamrip 1ficher</pre> <pre>Starfield: Digital Premium Edition DODI Repacks Torrent File</pre> <pre>Starfield: Digital Premium Edition DODI Repacks Magnet Link</pre> <pre>Starfield: Digital Premium Edition DODI Repacks DataNodes</pre> <pre>Starfield: Digital Premium Edition GameBounty Direct Download DataNodes</pre> <pre>SCNLOG RUNE NitroFlare</pre> <pre>SCNLOG RUNE ddownload</pre> <pre>SCNLOG mirrorrace</pre>"},{"location":"Movies/","title":"\ud83c\udfac Movies","text":""},{"location":"Movies/#the-substance","title":"The Substance","text":"The Substance <pre>1337x 1080p WEBRIP</pre> <pre>Braflix Streaming</pre> <pre>VegaMovies Direct Download 1080p WEB-DL</pre> <pre>MovieParadise Direct Download 1080p WEBRip</pre>"},{"location":"Movies/#28-days-later","title":"28 Days Later","text":"28 Days Later <pre>1337x 1080p BluRay</pre> <pre>Braflix Streaming</pre> <pre>VegaMovies Direct Download 1080p BluRay</pre> <pre>HydraHD Streaming</pre>"},{"location":"Movies/#top-gun-maverick","title":"Top Gun Maverick","text":"Top Gun Maverick <pre>1337x 1080p HDTS</pre> <pre>Braflix Streaming</pre> <pre>VegaMovies Direct Download 1080p BluRay</pre>"},{"location":"Movies/#star-wars-the-last-jedi","title":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi","text":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi <pre>1337x 1080p BluRay</pre> <pre>Braflix Streaming</pre> <pre>VegaMovies Direct Download 1080p</pre>"},{"location":"Movies/#interstellar","title":"Interstellar","text":"Interstellar <pre>1337x 1080p BluRay</pre> <pre>Braflix Streaming</pre> <pre>VegaMovies Direct Download HDR 4K HDR IMAX BluRay</pre>"},{"location":"Movies/#spider-man-far-from-home","title":"Spider-Man: Far From Home","text":"Spider-Man: Far From Home <pre>1337x 1080p WEBRip</pre> <pre>Braflix Streaming</pre> <pre>VegaMovies Direct Download 10bit 4K</pre>"},{"location":"Movies/#home-alone","title":"Home Alone","text":"Home Alone <pre>1337x 720p BluRay</pre> <pre>Braflix Streaming</pre> <pre>VegaMovies Direct Download 720p</pre>"},{"location":"Movies/#deadpool-wolverine","title":"Deadpool &amp; Wolverine","text":"Deadpool &amp; Wolverine <pre>1337x 1080p AMAZON WEBRip</pre> <pre>Braflix Streaming</pre> <pre>VegaMovies Direct Download 1080p</pre>"},{"location":"Movies/#inside-out-2","title":"Inside Out 2","text":"Inside Out 2 <pre>1337x 1080p WEBDL Magnet</pre> <pre>1337x 1080p WEBDL Torrent File</pre> <pre>Braflix Streaming</pre> <pre>VegaMovies Direct Download 1080p</pre>"},{"location":"Movies/#jaws","title":"Jaws","text":"Jaws <pre>1337x 4K BluRay Magnet Link</pre> <pre>1337x 720p BluRay Magnet Link</pre> <pre>1337x 4K BluRay Torrent File</pre> <pre>1337x 720p BluRay Torrent File</pre> <pre>HydraHD Streaming</pre> <pre>Braflix Streaming</pre> <pre>DDLBase Direct Download 1ficher 1080p BluRay MKV REMUX</pre>"},{"location":"Movies/#the-matrix","title":"The Matrix","text":"The Matrix <pre>1337x 720p BluRay Magnet Link</pre> <pre>1337x 720p BluRay Torrent File</pre> <pre>HydraHD Streaming</pre> <pre>Braflix Streaming</pre>"},{"location":"Movies/#titanic","title":"Titanic","text":"Titanic <pre>1337x 1080p Magnet Link</pre> <pre>1337x 720p Magnet Link</pre> <pre>1337x 3D BluRay Magnet Link</pre> <pre>1337x 1080p Torrent File</pre> <pre>1337x 720p Torrent File</pre> <pre>1337x 3D BlueRay Torrent File</pre> <pre>HydraHD Streaming</pre> <pre>Braflix Streaming</pre>"}]}
