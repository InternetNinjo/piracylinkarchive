#### Step 1: Obtaining the Links

Select links from [fmhy](https://fmhy.lol). Make sure to bypass any captchas and reach the final destination. If multiple hosts are available, list all of them in a [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com).

#### Step 2: Cloning the Repository

You need to clone the repository to your local machine and use a text editor to make changes. I recommend using Git as the client and Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as your editor.

#### Step 3: Formatting

Once you have the markdown file open in your editor, youâ€™ll need to add a new dropdown menu following this template:

```
---

## Name
<details>
<summary>NAME</summary>
<pre><a href="THE LINK" target="_blank">Source + Type + Group</a></pre>
</details> 
```

Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values. Make sure to label them correctly, specifying the source (e.g., FitGirl), type (e.g., Repack), and group (e.g., Rune). You can add additional metadata if necessary.

##### Adding more links to the dropdown:

For additional links, use the following format directly after the first link:

```
<pre><a href="THE LINK" target="_blank">Source + Type + Group</a></pre>
```

For example, if you are adding two links, the code should look like this:

```
## Name
<details>
<summary>NAME</summary>
<pre><a href="THE LINK" target="_blank">Source + Type + Group</a></pre>
<pre><a href="THE LINK" target="_blank">Source + Type + Group</a></pre>
</details> 
```

#### Step 4: Committing Your Changes

Once you've made the necessary changes, commit them and push the updates. Then, create a new pull request on Gitea. After your links are reviewed, they will be added to the main repository.

### Guidelines for Magnet/Torrent Users

**Avoid using The Pirate Bay.**

For game uploads, only use the following trusted uploaders: (any verified names from cs.rin.ru, Anadius, DODI, FitGirl, JohnCena141 (Linux), KaOsKrew, s7on3r, TinyRepacks).

For torrents, you must provide two versions of the link:
1. A magnet link.
2. A torrent file hosted on a trusted service like [fileditch](https://fileditch.com). Avoid using cashlinks, malware-ridden hosts, or anything similar.
