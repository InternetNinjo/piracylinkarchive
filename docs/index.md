## Rant

Big corporations are the fucking worst, and I’m so tired of people acting like they’re just “part of the system” or “too big to fail.” Nah, they’re *too big to give a shit* about anyone or anything that doesn’t involve lining their pockets. It’s all about money and power, and they’ll bulldoze whoever they need to get there. They’ve got more wealth than countries, they don’t pay their taxes, and they treat their workers like dirt. Let’s just stop pretending they’re good for society because they’re not.

First off, let’s talk about **greed**. It’s never enough for these corporate scumbags. They’re already raking in billions, but no, they need *more*. They could literally pay their employees living wages, solve world hunger, or fund public education, but instead, they hoard it. They sit on their piles of cash like goddamn dragons. Meanwhile, they’ve got their workers living paycheck to paycheck, barely scraping by while the CEO gets a new yacht. They’ll cut benefits, slash jobs, and outsource everything to sweatshops just to save a buck. All while we’re out here working ourselves to the bone. Tell me again how this system isn’t fucked.

And oh, let’s not forget about **monopolies**. These corporations don’t want competition—they want to own everything. They’ll buy up smaller companies, shut them down, and then jack up prices because, guess what, where the hell else are you going to go? Look at Amazon. It started selling books. Now? Now it’s swallowing up the entire economy. Groceries, healthcare, entertainment, you name it. One-stop shop for your entire fucking life. And what do we get out of it? A world where small businesses can’t survive, workers are disposable, and prices are sky-high once they’ve crushed all the competition. Great job, capitalism.

But what really boils my blood is how they treat **workers**. People act like getting a job at one of these big companies is some golden ticket, but it’s a golden ticket to *exploitation*. You’ve got Amazon workers pissing in bottles because they can’t take bathroom breaks. You’ve got people clocking in at fast food joints making less than minimum wage, living off tips because the corporation won’t pay them fairly. Meanwhile, CEOs are making millions *a day*. What kind of dystopian hell is this? And don’t even get me started on their union-busting bullshit. The second employees try to stand up for themselves and organize, these corporations come down like a ton of bricks, spreading lies, firing people, and doing everything they can to shut it down. How the hell are we supposed to fight back when they’ve rigged the whole game?

And these assholes have the audacity to act like they’re doing us a favor. Oh, look at us, we donated to some charity, we made our logo rainbow-colored for Pride Month, we’re “green” now because we use recycled plastic! Fuck off with that virtue-signaling crap. You think we don’t see through that? They’ll slap a rainbow on their brand for a month, then turn around and funnel money to anti-LGBTQ politicians. They’ll plant a tree here or there, but they’re still pumping out pollution like there’s no tomorrow. It’s all for show. They don’t care about people, the environment, or anything else. It’s all about their image, keeping the money flowing, and making sure we don’t realize just how bad they’re screwing us over.

Oh, and speaking of screwing us over, let’s talk about **the environment**. These corporations are literally destroying the planet for profit. They’ll pump oil, mine resources, and pollute the air and water like there’s no tomorrow. Why? Because it’s cheaper than doing the right thing. They’ll lobby governments to avoid regulations, lie about climate change, and even pretend to care with their fake “sustainability” initiatives. Meanwhile, the planet is on fire, species are going extinct, and entire ecosystems are collapsing. But yeah, let’s keep giving these companies a pat on the back for making their packaging “eco-friendly” while they’re choking the planet with plastic and CO2.

And don’t get me started on their **control over government**. Politicians are bought and sold by these corporations like it’s a fucking marketplace. Big Pharma, Big Tech, Big Oil—they’re all in bed with the government, writing laws that benefit themselves while screwing over the rest of us. They’ve got lobbyists crawling all over Capitol Hill, bribing politicians to make sure regulations stay lax, taxes stay low, and they get away with literal murder. They don’t want regulations, they don’t want accountability, and they sure as hell don’t want anything that might slow down their profit machine. Meanwhile, regular people are getting crushed by the weight of these corporate behemoths while the government sits back and lets it happen. Because why would they stop it when they’re getting a cut?

Big corporations are a disease. They ruin everything they touch. They destroy communities, exploit workers, pollute the environment, and corrupt governments. And for what? More money they don’t even need. It’s all about control. They want to own everything, and they’re damn close to it. The worst part is, we’re trapped in it. We need the jobs, the products, the services, but in the end, we’re just feeding the beast. They’ve got us in a chokehold, and unless we tear it down, they’re going to keep growing, keep exploiting, and keep fucking up everything for everyone except the few at the top.
