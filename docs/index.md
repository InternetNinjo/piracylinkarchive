Big corporations and DRM (Digital Rights Management) are the biggest assholes in the game, and I’m not even gonna sugarcoat it. These greedy fucks couldn’t give less of a shit about *u*, the paying customer. They’ve made it their mission to treat *everyone* like a thief, all while screwing over the legit folks who just wanna enjoy the stuff they bought without jumping through a thousand hoops.

Let’s break this down. U drop cash on a game, movie, or album, and what do u get in return? Some bullshit restrictions wrapped in DRM. Suddenly, it’s not *your* game anymore. Nah, it’s like u rented it and need permission from the corporate overlords every time u wanna use it. Wanna play that single-player game offline? Fuck u. Got bad internet? Screw u, u can’t even access what u paid for. It’s like these companies are saying, “Thanks for the money, but we still own *everything*, and u just have the privilege of playing when we say so.”

What makes it worse is how utterly pointless DRM is. These big-ass corporations invest millions into these systems, all in the name of “stopping piracy.” But guess what? It doesn’t even work. Hackers crack the DRM faster than it takes to boot up your damn console. So who gets punished here? Not the pirates—they’re playing that shit for free, DRM-free. It’s the legit buyers like u and me, the ones who are actually supporting the industry, that get bent over. It’s fucking ridiculous!

DRM makes *everything* worse. Remember buying music on iTunes back in the day? U had to deal with Apple’s restrictive DRM bullshit that only let u play your music on their devices. What the fuck is that about? U pay for the song, but they decide where u can play it. And if u wanted to use another player or device? Tough luck—buy it again or spend hours converting it just to listen to something u *own*. But do u *really* own it? Nope. They’ve got u by the balls with this digital prison.

And here’s the kicker: DRM doesn’t just mess with new stuff. It totally screws over older content too. Wanna play that game from 10 years ago? Oh wait, the DRM servers went offline? Well, fuck u, u can’t play it anymore. A game u bought with your hard-earned cash is now completely useless. It’s like these corporations are saying, “Thanks for supporting us, but screw your nostalgia or desire to revisit this game. We’ve moved on, and so should u.”

They also don’t give a flying fuck about privacy. Some DRM schemes are straight-up spyware. They’re snooping on your system, tracking data, and just invading your space, all under the guise of “stopping piracy.” It’s such bullshit. U paid for the game, and now they’re in your damn business? It’s like buying a couch, and the salesman comes over every week to sit on it and see how u’re using it. Get the fuck outta here with that nonsense.

At the end of the day, big corporations and DRM are just another way for these greedy assholes to keep control over everything while they laugh at u. They don’t trust u, they don’t respect u, and they sure as hell don’t care about u once they’ve got your money. Fuck DRM, and fuck the companies pushing this garbage on us.

Alright, let’s dive into how DRM isn’t just annoying as hell—it’s straight-up **anti-poor**, and that’s some bullshit. Most of us out here don’t have stacks of cash lying around, but these big corporations act like we’re all rolling in dough and can afford to pay for the same product multiple times or deal with their overpriced, restrictive nonsense. DRM basically tells people, “Hey, if you’re not rich enough to buy this shit *again* when something goes wrong, tough luck, sucker!”

Think about it. When u drop your hard-earned cash on something, u expect to own it, right? But DRM says, “Nah, you’re only renting this.” U get locked into using the product on one specific device or platform, and if u dare to upgrade your gear or switch systems? Guess what, u’re probably gonna have to buy it again. For people with money, maybe that’s not a big deal. But for those of us who can barely afford to make the first purchase, it’s a massive slap in the face. Like, we saved up, finally got the game or software we wanted, and now they expect us to cough up more cash just because we wanna use it on a different device? Fuck outta here with that.

DRM is essentially a middle finger to anyone who’s struggling financially. Can’t afford to constantly upgrade your internet? Well, sucks to be u, because a lot of these DRM-infested games require a constant connection, even for *single-player* games. So if u’re living somewhere where the internet is garbage or super expensive, u’re screwed. It’s like these companies are saying, “Only people with stable internet deserve to play this game.” It’s the most classist shit ever.

And let’s not forget about regions where legit media isn’t even available, or it’s priced so ridiculously high that no one can afford it. Some places have absurdly inflated prices for digital products, and then DRM locks u into buying from that region. U can’t even look for cheaper alternatives or import versions without getting hit by some stupid DRM restrictions. So, the poor folks living in places where media is priced sky-high? They’re stuck paying way more than rich countries, all while getting less freedom with how they can use it. That’s some next-level corporate greed right there.

And don’t even get me started on people who don’t have access to legit stores. Not everyone lives in a country where there’s a Best Buy on every corner, or where Steam, Netflix, or whatever works without restrictions. These companies act like the whole world is one big shopping mall with their products on every shelf, but for a lot of people, that’s just not reality. DRM makes it impossible for people in less privileged places to even access content without either paying way more or resorting to piracy. It’s like they’re saying, “If u can’t pay up or don’t live in the right country, too bad.”

This is why DRM feels like an attack on poor people. It’s designed by rich corporations for rich customers. It’s not made for people like us who are just trying to get by and enjoy something without breaking the bank. Instead of making content more accessible, they put up walls and say, “If u can’t afford to play by our rules, then fuck u.” It’s a greedy, classist system that punishes the very people who can’t afford to keep jumping through their hoops.

In the end, DRM does nothing but widen the gap between those who have money to burn and those who don’t. If u’re poor, u get stuck with fewer choices, more restrictions, and endless frustration while the wealthy get to bypass it all. It’s bullshit, and the sooner these corporations realize they’re screwing over the very people who need access the most, the better. But until then? DRM can go fuck itself.
